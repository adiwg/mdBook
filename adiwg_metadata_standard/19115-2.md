# 19115-2

*ISO 19115-2:2009 Geographic Information -- Metadata -- Part 2: Extensions for imagery and gridded data* is an extension for ISO 19115 and includes information on data properties, geospatial characteristics, processing and acquisition methods. This standard extends many of the core packages from ISO 19115 and describes new packages for documenting the plans and instruments through data is acquired.

NASA describes ISO 19115-2 and the ways it extends 19115 in the [Earthdata Wiki](https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/NASAISO/ISO+19115-2)
