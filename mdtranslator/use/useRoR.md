#mdTranslator

## Use Ruby on Rails

After installing the 'adiwg-mdtranlator' gem it can be accessed through a single exposed method - 'translate'.  Installation of the 'adiwg-mdtranslator' RubyGem was discussed in the section [Installation in Rails](../install/installInRails.md) if that has not already be done.  

Accessing the translate method in Rails is exactly the same as it is in [Ruby](useRubyGem.md).  You can view that section for more information.
