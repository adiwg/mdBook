# 19110

ISO 19110:2005 Geographic information â€“ Methodology for feature cataloguing is a separate standard and separate document that the ISO 19115 (or 19115-1, or 19115-2) will reference when necessary. The ISO 19110 is much like Section 5, Entity and Attribute Information, of the FGDC CSDGM.

NOAA describes the ISO 19110 and provides some examples of its use in the [Environmental Data Management Wiki](https://geo-ide.noaa.gov/wiki/index.php?title=ISO_19110_(Feature_Catalog)).
