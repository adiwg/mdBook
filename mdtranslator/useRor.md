#mdTranslator

## Usage

### Ruby on Rails

After installing the 'adiwg-mdtranlator' gem it can be access through a single exposed method - 'translate'.  Installation of the 'adiwg-mdtranslator' RubyGem was discussed in the section [Installation in Rails](../mdtranslator/installInRails.md) if that has not already be done.  

Accessing the translate method in Rails is exactly the same as it is in [Ruby](../mdtranslator/userubyGem.md).
