## Adding New Readers and Writers

To date only metadata file formats based in XML or JSON have been addressed by mdTranslator, but these two formats probably cover the world of metadata standards.  Because software tools, process, and testing differ between XML and JSON, as well as between readers and writers, guidelines for development has been divided into the following four sections.  There is naturally some overlap in the development processes but hopefully treating each in a separate section will help the documentation be more clear.

[__Add JSON Reader__](addJsonReader.md) - covers adding a reader for JSON formatted metadata files.  

[__Add XML Reader__](addXMLReader.md) - covers adding a reader for XML formatted metadata files.  

[__Add JSON Writer__](addJsonWriter.md) - covers adding a writer for JSON formatted metadata files.  

[__Add XML Writer__](addXMLWriter.md) - covers adding a writer for XML formatted metadata files.
