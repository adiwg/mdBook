## Overview

`adiwg-mdCodes` is a Ruby gem for delivering managed lists to an application.  mdCodes has a
set of methods to access a codelist and return the list in either a JSON object or Ruby hash.
Each 'static' codelist is stored in a single YAML file with a code, code name, and definition
for each codelist item.

`mdcodes` is the equivalent npm package.

The codelists were developed to support creation of ISO Geospatial Metadata standards and
were extended by the Alaska Data Integration working group (ADIwg) to support mdJSON.
