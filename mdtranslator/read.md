# Reader Functions

An mdTranslator reader performs two basic function: 1) to validate the input file meets the standards for the reader specification; and 2) load the contentents of the input file into the translator's internal object.

How these tasks are accomplished by a reader are dependent on the format and organization of the input metadata file.  The next sections will discuss how the mdJson reader embedded in mdTranslator meets these objectives.
