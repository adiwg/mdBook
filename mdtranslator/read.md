# Reader Functions

An mdTranslator Reader performs two basic function: 1) to validate the input file meets the standards for the Reader specification; and 2) load the contents of the input file into the translator's internal object.

How these tasks are accomplished by a Reader are dependent on the format and organization of the input metadata file.  The next sections will discuss how the mdJson Reader embedded in mdTranslator meets these objectives.
